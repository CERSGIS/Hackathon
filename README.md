# HACKATHON GUIDELINE DOCUMENTATION

## __INTRODUCTION__

The Sustainable Management of Wetland and Floods for Strengthening Food Security and Resilience of Ecosystems in West Africa (GDZIHAO) project is a support program for Environment and Security Monitoring (GMES & Africa). It was set up by the African Union in partnership with the European Union. The Center for Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Services (CERSGIS) and fourteen (14) other partners across West Africa intend to implement services to monitor wetlands management and flooding across the region. 
The European Union, through the support program, offers the possibility for African institutions to have free access to tools and geospatial technologies of the European Space Program (ESA). Such an opportunity facilitates access to applications, products, and services derived from Earth Observation (EO) data, and the geospatial information provided would be of great added value in improving knowledge for better monitoring and rational management of wetlands.
As part of the project activities, a hackathon to bring together groups of creative thinkers and problem-solvers to explore the use of EO data and computer coding is an efficient approach to address wetland challenges. 
This documentation will include the hackathon schedule, judging criteria, submission requirements, team formation rules, code of conduct, and any other relevant information. It will be shared with all participants at the beginning of the hackathon and will be made readily available for reference throughout the event. 

**DATE AND VENUE**

The event will take place on the 16th of June, 2023 from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. at the CERSGIS Training Room.

**GENERAL PROCEDURE**

###### *Duration*
The hackathon will take place over two months. 
The first month will be used for a meeting with the teams to provide a general overview of the GDZHIAO project and the hackathon itself. Possible themes or challenge areas will be discussed with participants.
In the second month, a period of 4 weeks will be allotted to the teams for adequate preparation and completion of their respective projects. In the second week of preparation, a progress meeting will be held for teams to ask questions, express concerns and give feedback on their progress so far.

###### *Team Size*
There will be a total of three groups, each consisting of 4 - 6 members.

###### *Satellite Imagery Requirements*
All satellite imagery used in the hackathon must be sourced exclusively from the Sentinel imagery. The Sentinel satellites, operated by the European Space Agency (ESA) as part of the Copernicus program, provide high-quality, open-access remote sensing data that can be used for a wide range of applications, including app development. It is important to adhere to this requirement and only use Sentinel imagery to ensure compliance with data usage policies, copyright laws, and ethical considerations. Please refrain from using any other satellite imagery during the hackathon to ensure fair and consistent use of data by all participants.

###### *Themes/Challenges*
Six different themes or challenges will be carefully curated to inspire creativity and innovation among the participants. These challenges will address solutions to challenges at specific Ramsar sites.
